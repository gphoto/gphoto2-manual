====== The gPhoto2 Manual ==============================================
========================================================================


Detailed information:
=====================

- this package depends on data from other packages
- this package depends on xmlto
- if we keep ChangeLog as created by cvs2cl we can save us a lot of hassle
- etc. pp.


Short build instructions:
=========================

If you use CVS, run autogen.sh first.

If you are a developer, add --enable-maintainer-mode to your configure
parameters.

Then configure and build The gPhoto2 Manual:

	./configure --with-doc-dir="/path/to/The_gPhoto2_Manual"
	make install

After that, you should have the manual in all built formats in
/path/to/The_gPhoto2_Manual

And BTW, you can build in a different directory if you wish.


Web site build instruction:
===========================

If your local copy of the gphoto website CVS module is in $(pwd)/../website,
just run

	./configure --with-html-dir=$(pwd)/../website/doc/manual
	make -C src/html clean install

to rebuild the manual for the website.
