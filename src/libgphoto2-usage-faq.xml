  <qandaentry id="FAQ-webcam">
    <question>
      <simpara>
        Is my webcam supported by libgphoto2 ? How can I use it ?
      </simpara>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <para>
        libgphoto2 is not meant in any way to use webcams. It only works
	with still image cameras, and is designed to fetch images out of the
	internal storage of these cameras. It also eventually can be used to 
	remote control the camera to take pictures, it the camera has support 
	for it and if the driver can do it. But not at all libgphoto2 has been
	designed to be tool to operate webcams nor do we support these devices. 
	There are other solutions for that. Try searching
	<ulink url="http://www.google.com/">Google</ulink>.

    <question>
      <simpara>Why do I get the error message "Could not claim the USB device"?</simpara>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <para>
	The exact message looks like
      </para>
      <screen>
*** Error ('Could not claim the USB device') ***

Could not claim interface 0 (Operation not permitted). Make sure no
other program or kernel module (e.g. dc2xx or stv680) is using the 
device and you have read/write access to the device. 
      </screen>
      <para>
	You have to make sure that no such kernel module is loaded and that
	you have set up the permissions on your USB device correctly,
	such that you have (non-root) write access to the camera device.
	How to set this up, is described at <xref linkend="permissions-usb"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
	This can also happen with cameras that works as USB Mass Storage devices.
	A notable example is if you have an Olympus Camera that gets auto-
	detected as an Olympus C-2040Z. In this case, you can try, if you run 
	Linux, to remove the usb-storage kernel module and attempt to use
	libgphoto2 with it. But, unless you want to control the camera (not all
	the model supports it), it is not a recommended solution. Keeps using USB
	Mass Storage. Some of these Olympus supports to be switched to "PC Control"
	mode in order to be remote controlled with an external program like one using 
	libgphoto2.

	Why does my Canon PowerShot G1/G2/Pro 90 IS not work with gphoto2

    </question>
    <answer>
      <para>
	This is a longstanding bug with the G1 and Pro 90 IS, and a
	relatively new bug with the G2. With the G2, it was 
	introduced with a new camera firmware (G2 1.0.0.0 worked,
	1.1.0.0 does not). We
	haven't fixed this bug yet since none of the active gphoto2
	developers owned one of these cameras until recently (i.e.
	updated his G2's firmware).
